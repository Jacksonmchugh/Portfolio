            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p>Thank you for showing some interest in me. I am from Atlanta, Ga. More specifically Marietta, Ga. A small town outside of Atlanta. I have lived here most of my life. I have done a few different jobs that just weren't what I was looking for long term. I have worked as an exterminator, an uber driver, I worked in the local government for the traffic department and most recently I work in a warehouse for Fedex. Each of these jobs has taught me a lot about how the world works. Doing these jobs I have had some interesting problems that I have had to find solutions for. Each one has made me look at things and approach things differently. Because of this I am good and finding different ways to problem solve. In my free time I like to stay active. I enjoy anything outdoors. If its hiking a trail, going to the beach or any water activity I am in! I do stay active with different sports. I try to go golfing when I can but mostly I am playing ultimate frisbee. I play on a travel team so we get to go to a few different cities a year. I am the kind of employee you are looking for. I will be there everyday, on time and ready to work. I can get along with anybody by putting aside any differences and focus on the common goal. I am hardworking and focused. If you have any other questions about work history or any personal history please look at the contact page and reach out to me! Thank you for visiting!  </p>
